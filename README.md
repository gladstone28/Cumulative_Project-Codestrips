CREATE A BACK-END APP WITH JAVASCRIPT
Cumulative Project: Codestrips
Let’s build an API for Codestrips! Codestrips is a small application to allow users to create and save small one-pane comic strips. You can select a head, body, background location, thought/speech bubble type, thought/speech bubble text, and caption for a strip. By the end of this project, you’ll be able to save these to a SQLite database and retrieve them so that they persist even when you restart your server.

You’ll use your knowledge of Express, SQLite, and the sqlite3 node module in order to create a Strip table and then set up a POST route for creating new strips and a GET route to retrieve all strips from the database.

You can start your server from the terminal window with node app.js and stop it with the Ctrl + C key command.

As you progress through the steps, you can test your work by interacting with the front-end web browser component or by running a test suite. To run the test suite in the terminal, enter the mocha command. This will run a test suite for all steps of the project. You won’t be able to run the server and test script in the same terminal window at the same time, so either stop your server before running the test script or open a second terminal window to run mocha.

Note: The files you edit in the code editor will auto-save as you work on them. To see updates from changes you make to your server code, make sure you stop and restart the server from the terminal and then refresh the browser if necessary. You can run the test suite in the terminal with the mocha command.
